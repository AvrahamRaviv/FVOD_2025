# FVOD: Formal Verification of Object Detection

This repository contains the oficial source code of our paper:
**Towards Formal Verification of Deep Neural Networks for Object Detection.**

## üìÅ Repository Structure

```
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ abcrown/    # Extended version of alpha-beta-CROWN with OD/IoU verification functionality  
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train/      # Pre-processing scripts (training models, etc.) and data preparation  
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analyze/    # Post-processing and result analysis  
 ```

- **abcrown/**: Forked and extended version of [alpha-beta-CROWN](https://github.com/Verified-Intelligence/alpha-beta-CROWN), adding support for object detection and IoU verification.
- **train/** and **analyze/**: Contain pre- and post-processing utilities.
- The main entry point is [`abcrown/FVOD/verify_fc.py`](abcrown/FVOD/verify_fc.py), which demonstrates minimal example usage. You can customize arguments as needed.

## üì¶ Requirements and Installation

The code was tested on a Mac with an Apple M3 chip (8-core CPU, 8-core GPU), 16GB RAM, running macOS 15.4.1 (24E263).

It builds upon the [alpha-beta-CROWN](https://github.com/Verified-Intelligence/alpha-beta-CROWN) framework. Our repository is based on the April 2024 release of alpha-beta-CROWN (commit `1a3533a`).

To set up the environment:

1. **Clone the repository and checkout the specific commit:**

   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/Verified-Intelligence/alpha-beta-CROWN.git
   cd alpha-beta-CROWN
   git checkout 1a3533a
   ```

2. **Create and activate the conda environment:**

   ```bash
   conda create -n alpha-beta-crown python=3.11 -y
   conda activate alpha-beta-crown
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r complete_verifier/requirements.txt
   ```
Our repository uses only modified pure-Python scripts and introduces no additional dependencies beyond those required by alpha-beta-CROWN.

After installing alpha-beta-CROWN, replace its source code with our modified version provided in the `abcrown/` folder of this repository.

## Usage

### Minimal Example

After completing installation and replacing the alpha-beta-CROWN source with our modified `abcrown/` folder, you can run a minimal verification example using:

```bash
python abcrown/FVOD/verify_fc.py --config abcrown/complete_verifier/exp_configs/OD/d_loc_init.yaml
````

This uses a configuration file for fast evaluation and correctness check.

### General Usage

To run verification with any custom configuration YAML:

```bash
python abcrown/FVOD/verify_fc.py --config path/to/your_config.yaml
```

You may customize model path, dataset, perturbation bounds, and verification settings directly in the YAML file.
